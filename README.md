# SQLStatementBuilder
A project to build different SQL statements based on user prompts
This project promps users to select a SQL statement type and then collects input to build a functional SQL command and save it in a .sql file.
!!IMPORTANT!! - The program saves to a fixed location [C:\temp]. You will either need to create this file if it does not exist, or redirect the code to a different location. This can be found in the QuerySaver.cs class on line 11.
